A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3, "text": "2005"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "2005"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "2005"}], "id": "572a0b101d046914007796e9", "question": "In what year did the Amazon experience its worst drought of recent history?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 386, "text": "Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research"}, {"answer_start": 386, "text": "Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research"}, {"answer_start": 386, "text": "Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research"}], "id": "572a0b101d046914007796eb", "question": "What organization argued that drought, among other effects, could cause the Amazon forest to reach a \"tipping point?\""}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 514, "text": "deforestation"}, {"answer_start": 514, "text": "deforestation on regional climate"}, {"answer_start": 514, "text": "deforestation"}], "id": "572a0b101d046914007796ec", "question": "Along with drought, what is one other factor that is pushing the Amazon rainforest towards a tipping point?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 710, "text": "savanna or desert"}, {"answer_start": 721, "text": "desert"}, {"answer_start": 710, "text": "savanna or desert"}], "id": "572a0b101d046914007796ed", "question": "What might the Amazon forest become if it passes the tipping point and starts to die?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 246, "text": "Woods Hole Research Center"}, {"answer_start": 246, "text": "Woods Hole Research Center"}, {"answer_start": 246, "text": "Woods Hole Research Center"}], "id": "572a0b101d046914007796ea", "question": "What organization predicted that the Amazon forest could survive only three years of drought?"}]}, {"context": "In 2010 the Amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought.
