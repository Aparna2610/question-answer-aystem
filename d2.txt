A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity.

In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.

Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 291, "text": "toward the center of the curving path"}, {"answer_start": 302, "text": "center of the curving path."}, {"answer_start": 298, "text": "the center of the curving path"}, {"answer_start": 282, "text": "directed toward the center of the curving path"}], "id": "5737a5931c456719005744e7", "question": "Where does centripetal force go?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 346, "text": "perpendicular"}, {"answer_start": 346, "text": "perpendicular"}, {"answer_start": 346, "text": "perpendicular"}, {"answer_start": 346, "text": "perpendicular"}], "id": "5737a5931c456719005744e8", "question": "How do centripetal forces act in relation to vectors of velocity?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 837, "text": "centripetal"}, {"answer_start": 224, "text": "unbalanced centripetal force"}, {"answer_start": 224, "text": "unbalanced centripetal force"}, {"answer_start": 837, "text": "centripetal"}], "id": "5737a5931c456719005744e9", "question": "What force changes an objects direction of travel?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 829, "text": "radial"}, {"answer_start": 829, "text": "radial (centripetal) force"}, {"answer_start": 829, "text": "radial"}, {"answer_start": 829, "text": "radial"}], "id": "5737a5931c456719005744ea", "question": "What is another word for centripetal force?"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 729, "text": "tangential force"}, {"answer_start": 729, "text": "tangential force"}, {"answer_start": 729, "text": "tangential force"}, {"answer_start": 729, "text": "tangential force"}], "id": "5737a5931c456719005744eb", "question": "What is resposible for speeding up or slowing down an object?"}]}, {"context": "A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
